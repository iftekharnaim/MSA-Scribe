This directory contains the source codes and datasets for aligning multiple captions using A* search based Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA).

The directory “./data” contains the necessary data files. Our experiments are performed on 4 audio files. The 10 partial captions for each of these audio files are provided in the following sub-directories:

./data/e6p11
./data/e6p22
./data/sch1p11
./data/sch1p22

The ground truth captions for these four audio files are provided in the directory:
