This directory contains the source codes and datasets for aligning multiple captions using A* search based Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA).


Data:
=====

The directory “./data” contains the necessary data files. Our experiments are performed on 4 audio files. The 10 partial captions for each of these audio files are provided in the following sub-directories:

./data/e6p11
./data/e6p22
./data/sch1p11
./data/sch1p22

The ground truth captions for these four audio files are provided in the directory:
./data/ground


MSA-A*:
=======
The directory “./msa_astar/” contains the Java code for aligning partial captions using MSA. A detailed descriptions of how to compile and run the code can be found at:
