even if you had a decision tree computer whatever that is okay but lets prove this theorem that decision trees in some sense model comparison sorting algorithms which we call just comparison sorts so this is a transformation and we are going to build one tree for each value of n so mention that the the decision trees depend on n the algorithm hopefully does well it depends on n but it works for all values of n and were just going to think of the algorithm as splitting into two forks the left subtree and the right subtree to

lets never forget about dreaming so if we want to dream and imagine that man will return to the moon or maybe even go to mars we are going to have to be able to produce oxygen a little like the pioneers produce oxygen from local produce resources structural metals and even produce photovoltaic silica so they can generate their own energy from local resources and so electrochemistry is the key enabler for that as well now lets turn to the whole underpinning of 3091 and if we take a look at the performance of engineering any engineering system it is a combination of the design and a construction now the construction is both the workmanship and the choice of materials now how do we choose materials we choose them on the basis of their properties so for example heres an application a beverage container this what i am holding is made out of an aluminum alloy
lets never forget about dreaming if we want to dream and imagine that man will return go to the moon mars produce oxygen from generate own resources and so chemistry electrochemistry is the key enabler for that as we will lets turn to the whole underpinning underpenny of 3091 any system it is a combination of the design and the construction how do we choose materials we choose them on the basis of their properties aluminum alloy

an exit over the top back so you leave to your left and that way it will be easier for the next class to come in maybe we can persuade the people here before us to do the same and that will be easy to change i do not know why but theres this sort of everybody has to charge to this door and i am just standing here and watching people collide i dont know it is an interesting social experiment there are two doors i do not understand why people do this but im not in the social sciences recitations will meet tuesdays and thursdays so youll go to the same hour on tuesday and thursday the section should be roughly students thats where the question and answer occurs here its largely i talk you listen ive got a time for questions like hey should not that be a minus sign i can take something really quick but where you get to really interact with the instructor is in recitation and ive given a direction
exit the top back leave to your left and that way it will be easier for the next class to come in i do not know why but just stand everybody has to charge to this door and watch people collide there are 2 doors i do not understand why people do this but in social sciences recitations will meet tuesdays and thursdays the sections should be roughly twenty students the should be question and answer occurs here it is largely i talk you listen can take something where you get to really interact with the instructor is have
plug so over to is exit to exit by the top back bad leave to your left maybe and that way it will be easier for the next class to come in i do not know why but theres just stand of everybody has to charge through to this dorr door there door and watch people collide stand there are 2 doors and i do am not understand why people do this but not in social sciences so you recitations will go into the sam hour meet tuesdays and that is thursdays the that sections should be roughly twenty students that is when the should not be twenty students minus sign question and answer occurs here it is largely and answer occurs i talk got you listen but can take something where quick where you can really get to really class in rescitation i interact with the instructor is have given have given direction to my recitation
over leave to the your left back it will be easier for the next class to your left to i do not everybody has to charge to this door and are 2 doors i do not understand i do this but not in understand why social do sciences recitations will meet tuesdays and thursdays students should be the question and answer occurs where largely i talk you really interact with the i really have given to interact with
by top back exit leave to your left and that way it will be easier for the top back leave to the your class next left come in i maybe do not why everybodf know but we can persuadet to has the charge people to for this charge us i just to door stand here and watch people collide there are 2 doors and i do not understand why people i do this but i am not in social sciences recitations will meet tuesdays and thursday the sections should hour be roughly twenty students that is where the question and answer occurs here it is largely i talk you listen can take where something you get a to really interact with the instructor is in rescitation i get have you to given really direction to my recitation

chemistry electro electrical chemistry a elentrical branch is the hte most important branch of chemistry do you notice some a theme in my professional life see i have tenure so what does that it mean oyu yo it means you find your passion and pursue it you do not waste time that trivia you find your and your purse it waste time on trivia that is what i urge you to do not find your passion and pursue persue it find so professoral life liquids waste time your trivial what is my passion is anything but water let the rest of the world work on water i am in the school of pursue it not acqueous media what is the reason for this what is in thisits an application a school of engineering so on water is the reason for this theres an application metal production right now i am interested in environmentally sound methods also a school of engineering recycled now looking at into titanium and iron recycling we will also interested in mobile energy storage for mkobile power electrochemistry see this chemistry as it applies to energy storage she is got the cell phone not even looking power see this gal here phone she is got this cell phone so mobile an dshes not even looking where she is driving laughing making safe batteries batterys out of earth abundant accessible materials abundenc portable power ultimately to drive the car with electrons imported safe paying to where she is driving electric fuel to eliminate this countries eliminate with this countrys dependence on imported petroleum oil electrons electric fuel we can do it how by inventing learn and the way we are going to event invent lessons in 3091 a battery that can send that a car care is by 250 miles on a single charge show the car 250 miles on a single charge and put it in the showroom in it only a show for the same price as a car with the internal combustion engine theo 250 miles on a single charge the only thing that stands between that image imagine and wehre where we are today and is invention store the requisite material engine is right here stand image also looking in this class store the grid at colossal batteries classroom today is lets here in this enable renewables wind solar lastly wind enable and renewables lastly lets never not forget about dreaming if we want to dream and dream imagine that mean man will return to the moon or mane will return are going to have to be able to we maybe even go to mars produce oxygen from local resource structural metals live like the pioneers generate own so they can generate pholtovoltaic to generate their own energy from local resources and so electrochemistry silicone so chemistry is the key enabler for that now as we will so lets turn to nergery from renewable resoureces the whole under underpinning underpenny of 3091 301 it is a combination any engingerring on 091 for all of this any engenierring system choice it is a combination of the a design and the dn construction now how do we choose materials we choose them on the a if now the constructions is both the worksmansip so heres an application what i am holding basis of their properties a beverage containers property this container it is made of an aluminum alloy it is a metal holding is made out of aluminum alloy it is a metal of i was your age they had steel beverage cans an aluminum alloy you can take the same beverage and glass bottle you can contain it in a glass bottle bottel you can contain it in a polymer bottle has why how do we make those choices they have the right mix of properties tehse various choices how do you determine the choices of properties are determined by the their composition so i it would dissolve but composition is important but not make this think out of sodium chloride it would dissolve example atomic arrangement is important improtnat as we will half inch thick halfinch thick pine board compared to as we will both pine compared to a half inch thick piece of plywood halfinch 1 solid pineboard versus plywood but hte halfinch thick i can take that pineboard but the halfinch thick pine board and if i can fracture it northsouth strike it is oneeighth but the half 1 eigth 18th inch sheet prime if think strike 18th inch not do that cross laminated 18 sheet ply 18 inch eastwest sheet pine 18th laminated 1 eighth inch north south 18th east west 18 inch east west if i try tried to ot cut through that the board i can will not icant advance the fracture so the thesis of 3091 in 1 eighth inch same composition 3019 3091 of 3091 is that relationship between it structure holds the way composition different atomic arrangement the electronic structure of the elements holds the key to understanding once you have properties so ot understanding we first block composition and that composition and away we go is how we got the syllabus of 3091 you make that selection general your 2 major blocks first 5 for 3091 that is first and the fundamental that is about 5 weeks same stuff you will get here the sam youve you have and then here we will part company and in 3091 did 5111 51112 block is general principles of chemistry the basics of electronic structure 3091 we dig down to then we part company and bonding dig down into solid state chemistry company everything that you can not all of this is will be burned need to pdf and going to take burned to into pdf and going everything to website everything that you see in this class goes up is be burned to pdf and put on the screen goes look website all of this on the screen is archived for you this lecture is being video recorded and within an hour will posted at so in the webstire by you within an hour now be on at the website unlikely event that you can not quite come to class it is available will be so in the unlikely event available that here can not am going to class it is available now get going on this subject then i am going to do is introductions some of the operational of the class this is the key so person get going operation is could then i divided or could not have been trying very hard the text is a twovolume set by avril

electrochemistry is the most important branch of chemistry you notice some theme in my professional life see i have tenure so what does that mean it means you find your passion and pursue it you do not waste time on trivia that is what i urge you to do find your passion and pursue it so what is my passion my passion is electrochemistry and nonaqueous media anything but water let the rest of the world work on water work on ionic liquid polymers what is the reason for this theres no application i am in the school of engineering i am interested in environmentally sound technologies for metal production right now looking at titanium iron recycling as well also interested in electrochemistry as it applies to energy storage energy storage for mobile power see this gal here she has the cell phone shes not even looking where she is driving so making safe batteries out of earth abundant accessible materials for portable power ultimately to drive the car with electrons electric fuel to eliminate this countrys dependence on imported petroleum we can do it how by inventing by inventing and the way we are going to invent is to learn the lessons in 3091 that will give us the chemistry we need to invent the battery that can send that car miles on a single charge and put it in the showroom for the same price as a car with an internal combustion engine the only thing that stands between that image and where we are today is invention and the requisite material is right here in this class also looking at colossal batteries store the grid enable renewables wind solar and then lastly lets never forget about dreaming so if we want to dream and imagine that man will return to the moon or maybe even go to mars we are going to have to be able to produce oxygen a little like the pioneers produce oxygen from local produce resources structural metals and even produce photovoltaic silica so they can generate their own energy from local resources and so electrochemistry is the key enabler for that as well now lets turn to the whole underpinning of 3091 and if we take a look at the performance of engineering any engineering system it is a combination of the design and a construction now the construction is both the workmanship and the choice of materials now how do we choose materials we choose them on the basis of their properties so for example heres an application a beverage container this what i am holding is made out of an aluminum alloy it is a metal when i was your age they had steel cans you can take this same beverage and contain it in a glass bottle you can contain it in a polymer bottle why do we make those various choices because they have the right mix of properties now how do you determine the properties properties obviously are determined by the composition i would not make this thing out of sodium chloride it would dissolve the composition is important but atomic arrangement is important as well example is half inch thick pine board compared to a half inch thick piece of plywood both pine but the half inch thick pine board is one solid pine board i can take that pine board and i can fracture it if i strike it along the grain but the half inch thick plywood i cant do that because it is eighth inch sheet pine cross laminated inch north south eighth inch eastwest eigth inch north south eighth inch eastwest if i try to cut through that board i cant advance the fracture same composition different atomic arrangement the thesis of is that the electronic structure of the elements holds the key to understanding that relationship between composition atomic arrangement and properties once you have properties thats how you make your selection and away we go thats how we got the syllabus of 3091 the syllabus has 2 major blocks first block is general principles of chemistry going to be about the first 5 weeks and thats the same stuff that you get here the basics of electronic structure and bonding then we part company and in 3091 we dig down into solid state chemistry you do not have to take notes you can relax all of this is going to be burned to pdf and posted at the website so everything that you see in this class that goes up on the screen is archived for you this lecture is being video recorded right now and within an hour it will be posted at the website so in the unlikely event that you cant quite come to class it is available

The graphical model output:
a electrochemistry electro chemistry electral electrical is the most important chemistry branch of important chemisty do is the most you notice branch some theme i have a tenure in my what so professional does life that it means that means you find your passion and means pursue it you do not waste time on trivia that is what i your urge you to do find your passion and pursue it so what is find my your passion and pursue it is anything but water let the rest of the world work on water what is i am in the reason for this i am what is in a school of the engineering interested right now looking metal i am production interested in environmentally at titanium sound methods iron recycling also as we will interested energy in electrochemistry storage for mobile power she see is this got the cell here mobile phone and gal not even looking where she is driving so got making this not even safe looking cell batteries phone where she is out of earth abundant materials ultimately portable power to drive the car with electron electric fuel to elimiante this countrys can depenednce it on countries imported we do petrolium how by inventing by inventing learn the way we and are going to invent lessons in by 3091 invent and send a the bttery that 250 car miles can send put it on a single charge show room in that car internal same price for combustioon as the engine image with and wehre a thing only car stands image we are today the between is that invention and the requisite where material is invention right here we in this today class store enable colossal the renewables grid batteries wind solar lastly lets never and forget about dreaming lets if we want to dream and imagine that man will return to the moon produce mars go to oxygen moon have live to like to pioneers from local resources and even produce strucutural metals to so generate their own energy from local and resources and so electrochemistry chemistry is the key enabler for that as we will lets now turn to the whole underpinning underpenny of 3091 any it is a combination system of the design and constructions is both the instruction we how do choose materials we choose them on the basis of their property beverage containers an aluminum made this out it of is alloy it is i a made of aluminum steel was your is age beverage they alloy had you cans take this same you beverage cans and contain it in a glass bottle you cans contain it in a polymer bottle why do we make those choices right they mix have of the various properties how you determine properties are determined make this would out of sodium it chloride dissolve by i properties the compostition composition so but is atomic it important arrangment atomic arrangement is important as we will half inch halfinch thick pine board compared to a halfinch thick piece half both inch of plywood pine but the halfinch board thick 1 i can solid take that pine board and fracture it if i strike it along fracture pine 18th it board is i can not do that but the can half inch sheet cross laminated ply 1 eignth 18 inch north south east west eastwest 18 inch east west if i try to cut through that board i can not advance the the fracture so the thesis of electronic 3091 is holds that relationship elements between structure composition of the and once you have the key composition different the structure atomic arrangement the key ot understanding that and is how properties we you make that got the syllabus of 3091 major first 2 block is selection how you make 5 first that general weeks is the same stuff you of will get basics here the chemistry electronic and then structure we will part company and in 3091 we dig down into solid state chemistry you can relax all of this will burned be is going to pdf burned and posted to website into everything that you the see in this class goes pdf up on the screen is archived for you this lecture is video recorded being and within an hour will posted at so the unlikely event that you can not quite come to class the so i to this i could a it is will availabale be

chemistry electro electrical chemistry a elentrical branch is the hte most important branch of chemistry do you notice some a theme in my professional life see i have tenure so what does that it mean oyu yo it means you find your passion and pursue it you do not waste time that trivia you find your and your purse it waste time on trivia that is what i urge you to do not find your passion and pursue persue it find so professoral life liquids waste time your trivial what is my passion is anything but water let the rest of the world work on water i am in the school of pursue it not acqueous media what is the reason for this what is in thisits an application a school of engineering so on water is the reason for this theres an application metal production right now i am interested in environmentally sound methods also a school of engineering recycled now looking at into titanium and iron recycling we will also interested in mobile energy storage for mkobile power electrochemistry see this chemistry as it applies to energy storage she is got the cell phone not even looking power see this gal here phone she is got this cell phone so mobile an dshes not even looking where she is driving laughing making safe batteries batterys out of earth abundant accessible materials abundenc portable power ultimately to drive the car with electrons imported safe paying to where she is driving electric fuel to eliminate this countries eliminate with this countrys dependence on imported petroleum oil electrons electric fuel we can do it how by inventing learn and the way we are going to event invent lessons in 3091 a battery that can send that a car care is by 250 miles on a single charge show the car 250 miles on a single charge and put it in the showroom in it only a show for the same price as a car with the internal combustion engine theo 250 miles on a single charge the only thing that stands between that image imagine and wehre where we are today and is invention store the requisite material engine is right here stand image also looking in this class store the grid at colossal batteries classroom today is lets here in this enable renewables wind solar lastly wind enable and renewables lastly lets never not forget about dreaming if we want to dream and dream imagine that mean man will return to the moon or mane will return are going to have to be able to we maybe even go to mars produce oxygen from local resource structural metals live like the pioneers generate own so they can generate pholtovoltaic to generate their own energy from local resources and so electrochemistry silicone so chemistry is the key enabler for that now as we will so lets turn to nergery from renewable resoureces the whole under underpinning underpenny of 3091 301 it is a combination any engingerring on 091 for all of this any engenierring system choice it is a combination of the a design and the dn construction now how do we choose materials we choose them on the a if now the constructions is both the worksmansip so heres an application what i am holding basis of their properties a beverage containers property this container it is made of an aluminum alloy it is a metal holding is made out of aluminum alloy it is a metal of i was your age they had steel beverage cans an aluminum alloy you can take the same beverage and glass bottle you can contain it in a glass bottle bottel you can contain it in a polymer bottle has why how do we make those choices they have the right mix of properties tehse various choices how do you determine the choices of properties are determined by the their composition so i it would dissolve but composition is important but not make this think out of sodium chloride it would dissolve example atomic arrangement is important improtnat as we will half inch thick halfinch thick pine board compared to as we will both pine compared to a half inch thick piece of plywood halfinch 1 solid pineboard versus plywood but hte halfinch thick i can take that pineboard but the halfinch thick pine board and if i can fracture it northsouth strike it is oneeighth but the half 1 eigth 18th inch sheet prime if think strike 18th inch not do that cross laminated 18 sheet ply 18 inch eastwest sheet pine 18th laminated 1 eighth inch north south 18th east west 18 inch east west if i try tried to ot cut through that the board i can will not icant advance the fracture so the thesis of 3091 in 1 eighth inch same composition 3019 3091 of 3091 is that relationship between it structure holds the way composition different atomic arrangement the electronic structure of the elements holds the key to understanding once you have properties so ot understanding we first block composition and that composition and away we go is how we got the syllabus of 3091 you make that selection general your 2 major blocks first 5 for 3091 that is first and the fundamental that is about 5 weeks same stuff you will get here the sam youve you have and then here we will part company and in 3091 did 5111 51112 block is general principles of chemistry the basics of electronic structure 3091 we dig down to then we part company and bonding dig down into solid state chemistry company everything that you can not all of this is will be burned need to pdf and going to take burned to into pdf and going everything to website everything that you see in this class goes up is be burned to pdf and put on the screen goes look website all of this on the screen is archived for you this lecture is being video recorded and within an hour will posted at so in the webstire by you within an hour now be on at the website unlikely event that you can not quite come to class it is available will be so in the unlikely event available that here can not am going to class it is available now get going on this subject then i am going to do is introductions some of the operational of the class this is the key so person get going operation is could then i divided or could not have been trying very hard the text is a twovolume set by avril
