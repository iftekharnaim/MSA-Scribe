six six nine is bigger than nine is six so we go this way and then we compare the second element and the claim is this is the correct permutation of the elements so that works out if i wrote this down right this is a sorting algorithm in the decision tree algorithm so in general you can say the rules of the game in general we have elements you want to sort and i only drew the has a label of the form i colon where i and are between one and and this means that we compare a with a and we have two subtrees for every such node we have the left subtree which tells you what the algorithm does what if it comes out less than and we have to be a little bit careful because because it could also come out equal less than or equal to and the right subtree strictly greater than so that is a little bit more precise than what we are doing here but in general we care about the equality case too so that was the internal nodes and then each leaf node gives a permutation so in order to be the answer to the sorting problem that better have the property that it orders the elements some permutation on things such that a pi one is less than and so on okay so that is the definition of a decision tree any binary tree with these kinds of labels it is a sorting algorithm in the decision tree model as you might expect this is not we have these four insertion sort all of them can be translated into the decision tree model it is not a terribly useful one for writing down an algorithm as a definition of quicksort or a definition of merge sort it depends on the size of the input that is a good point now we could try to write down and instruction that would give us sort of a real algorithm but even then this is not a terribly convenient representation lets write down a transformation that to a decision tree this is not a useless model otherwise i would not be telling you but as writing down an algorithm this tree is not so useful
